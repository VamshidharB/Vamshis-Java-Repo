I am Vamshidhar Bodhankar I have 10 years of experience in full stack development. Currently, I'm working with the ABC technologists, which is a healthcare domain.My major part of my work is to develop the user stories which I have, which are provided by the business users.For the front end, I use the React js, HTML, JavaScript and CSS technologies, for the back end, I use the JAVA Spring, Spring Boot concepts, etc. In order to connect front end and back end, I used the REST API services and the data and the REST API services are in the form of JSON files. I use the MySQL database and the connection which I use as the Hibernate. I most deal with the user stories development, fixing the production issues, and maintenance of the application. That's pretty much about me.

I am currently working on a Windows-based application that also functions as a one-page, internet-based application. The main purpose of this application is to display medical reports of patients to their respective doctors. To build the user interface, I am utilizing the React framework along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies. For the backend, I am employing Java Spring Boot concepts and Java Spring components. Additionally, I am using a couple of microservices to handle the reports stored in the database. While most of the reports are located in the database, some are also stored in the cloud. To facilitate cloud storage, we are leveraging AWS services, and for establishing the database connection, we are utilizing Hyperlink. The database being used is MySQL.
